# Detection_of_Surge_Arrestor

With the ultimate goal of bestowing upon electric robots higher intelligence, this paper is anchored in practical field tasks in the power systems, and enables electric robots to discover and determine whether or not the target is a surge arrester and finally prepare for disassembling the nut on it. Firstly, by taking advantage of image processing techniques, mathematical morphology, RGB and HSV characteristics, Hough transform in particular, we successfully detected the surge arrester and the nut on it. Secondly, we applied two machine learning approaches to train separate models which can be used to determine if the detected dominant area is what we expected. One approach is auto encoder model that utilizes the original picture as its input, the other is SVM model using HOG features. According to evaluation results, both can accurately predict the target if it is a surge arrester. Their generalization error is 0.01 when the confidence level is 95%. Whatâ€™s more, they performed well and similarly in precision, recall as well as ROC curve.
